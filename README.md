# New River Valley Business Help

What is this project?
------
This is a project designed to help people get their businesses started in the New River Vally of Virginia. Initially, it'll focus on Montgomery County including the towns of Blacksburg and Christiansburg. There are a number of pages and resources already available about getting your business license and registering with the different municipalities, but many of these tend to be disparate and can be confusing. We aim to consolidate and simplify this information.
* Current plan is for an HTML and Javascript static website

Hack for Change 2016
------
As part of our participation in the [Hack for Change/National Day of Civic Hacking](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016), we're planning to incorporate our work on this project with the [Applying for a Business License](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016/challenge-applying-for-a-business-license) national challenge.
