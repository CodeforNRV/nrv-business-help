# Starting a business in the New River Valley

### What is this project?
This is a project designed to help people get their businesses started in the New River Vally of Virginia. Initially, it'll focus on Montgomery County including the towns of Blacksburg and Christiansburg. There are a number of pages and resources already available about getting your business license and registering with the different municipalities, but many of these tend to be disparate and can be confusing. We aim to consolidate and simplify this information.
